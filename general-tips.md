# General Tips for Freezing & Reheating

## Preparation

- **Cool Completely**: Always let the cooked food cool completely before portioning and freezing. This prevents ice crystals and helps maintain texture.
- **Portioning**: Divide the cooled meals into your individual glass containers.
- **Headspace**: Leave a little space (about 1/2 inch) at the top of the container to allow for expansion during freezing.
- **Seal Well**: Ensure your containers have tight-fitting lids or cover the top securely with foil and/or plastic wrap before putting the lid on to prevent freezer burn.
- **Label**: Clearly label each container with the contents and the date it was made.

## Reheating

- **From Frozen**: You can usually bake these directly from frozen. Remove any plastic wrap. If using foil, you can leave it on for the first part of baking to prevent over-browning, then remove it towards the end. Expect longer baking times (e.g., 45-60+ minutes at 350-375°F or 175-190°C, depending on the dish and density).
- **Thawed**: For quicker reheating, thaw a container in the refrigerator overnight. Baking time will be significantly reduced (maybe 20-30 minutes at 350°F/175°C).
- **Internal Temp**: Always ensure the meal is heated through to a safe internal temperature (165°F or 74°C).
