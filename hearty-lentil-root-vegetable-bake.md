# Hearty Lentil & Root Vegetable Bake (Shepherd's Pie Style)

A comforting, stew-like filling topped with mashed vegetables instead of pastry.

## Ingredients (makes multiple portions)

### For the Filling
- 1 cup brown or green lentils, rinsed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced small
- 2 celery stalks, diced small
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Topping
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (or regular potatoes, or a mix)
- Splash of milk (dairy or non-dairy) or broth
- Salt and pepper

## Assembly

1. **Make the filling**: 
   - Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. 
   - Saut√© onion, carrots, and celery until softened (about 5-7 minutes). 
   - Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. 
   - Stir in lentils, broth, thyme, and bay leaf. 
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until lentils are tender but not mushy. 
   - Remove bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. 
   - If it's too liquidy, simmer uncovered for a few more minutes to thicken.

2. **Make the topping**: 
   - While lentils cook, boil the sweet potato (or potato) cubes until very tender. 
   - Drain well. 
   - Mash with a splash of milk/broth, salt, and pepper until smooth.

3. **Assemble**: 
   - Divide the lentil filling among your glass containers. 
   - Top evenly with the mashed sweet potato topping, spreading it to the edges. 
   - You can use a fork to create some texture on top.
   - Cool completely.

## Freezing & Reheating

1. **Freezing**: Seal and freeze.
2. **Baking**: Bake until the filling is bubbly and the topping is heated through and lightly browned.
