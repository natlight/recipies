# Mediterranean Chickpea & Spinach Bake

A savory bake with Mediterranean flavors, featuring chickpeas and hearty greens.

## Ingredients (per portion)

- 1/2 cup chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 cup chopped spinach or kale (frozen works well, thaw and squeeze dry)
- 1/4 cup diced tomatoes (canned, drained)
- 2 tbsp chopped Kalamata olives (optional)
- 2 tbsp chopped sun-dried tomatoes (oil-packed, drained, optional)
- 1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced or diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1-2 tbsp crumbled feta cheese (add before baking)
- Drizzle of olive oil
- Splash of vegetable broth or water if mixture seems too dry

## Assembly

1. In a bowl, combine chickpeas, spinach/kale, diced tomatoes, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes.
2. Stir in a small drizzle of olive oil. If the mixture looks very dry, add a tablespoon or two of broth or water.
3. Transfer the mixture to your glass container.
4. Cool completely.

## Freezing & Reheating

1. **Freezing**: Seal and freeze.
2. **Baking**: Before baking (whether from frozen or thawed), sprinkle the feta cheese over the top. Bake until heated through and the feta is slightly golden.
