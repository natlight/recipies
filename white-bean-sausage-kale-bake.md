# White Bean, Sausage (Optional), and Kale Bake

A rustic, flavorful bake combining white beans, hearty greens, and optional savory sausage.

## Ingredients (per portion)

- 1/2 cup cannellini or great northern beans, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 cup chopped kale, stems removed
- Optional: 1 cooked chicken or turkey sausage link, sliced or crumbled
- 1/4 cup diced onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- Pinch of dried rosemary or sage
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Grated Parmesan cheese for topping (add before baking)

## Assembly

1. If using sausage and it's raw, brown it first. If using pre-cooked, simply slice or crumble.
2. In a bowl, combine the beans, kale, sausage (if using), onion, garlic, broth, rosemary/sage, salt, and pepper. Stir well. The kale will seem bulky but will wilt down during baking.
3. Transfer the mixture to your glass container.
4. Cool completely (if sausage was just cooked).

## Freezing & Reheating

1. **Freezing**: Seal and freeze.
2. **Baking**: Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if desired, before baking. Bake until hot, bubbly, and the kale is tender.
